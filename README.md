# Moroccan NT T-Shirts - Beginner Project

This is a simple beginner project I made when I was first learning **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The idea was to create a small online store for selling Moroccan national team (NT) T-shirts.

> 💡 This project is not connected to a real database or backend. It’s just static HTML, CSS, and a bit of JS to help me learn how websites are built.

## 🧾 Pages in This Project

### 1. `index.html`  
This is the homepage. It shows the **same Moroccan T-shirt** multiple times, like a product listing.  
Each product has a name, image, and a price.

### 2. `login.html`  
This is a very simple login page. It only has two input fields:
- Username  
- Password  
It doesn’t connect to any real system – it's just for practice.

### 3. `product.html`  
This is a basic single product page. It shows the same T-shirt again with:
- A bigger image  
- Description  
- Maybe a "Buy Now" button (not working – just for design)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – to structure the pages  
- **CSS** – to style the pages (colors, fonts, layout)  
- **JavaScript** – very basic usage, like maybe alerts or handling a button click

## 🔍 What I Learned

- How to link HTML pages together  
- How to use CSS for styling  
- How to use images in a project  
- A little bit of JavaScript to make buttons work (kind of 😅)
